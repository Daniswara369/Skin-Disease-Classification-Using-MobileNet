# Skin Disease Classification Using MobileNet

This project develops a skin disease classification model using the MobileNet architecture. The model can identify five types of skin diseases from images: actinic keratosis, dermatofibroma, melanoma, pigmented benign keratosis, and vascular lesion.
The model is designed to assist in the early diagnosis of skin diseases using deep learning with MobileNet, which is efficient for use on mobile devices.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled images of skin diseases sourced from various dermatological repositories.

## Methods

- **Data Preprocessing:** Resizing images, normalization, and data augmentation.
- **Model Training:** Training the model using the preprocessed dataset.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using accuracy and loss.
